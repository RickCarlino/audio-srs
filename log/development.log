Mongoid::Errors::InvalidFind (
Problem:
  Calling Document.find with nil is invalid.
Summary:
  Document.find expects the parameters to be 1 or more ids, and will return a single document if 1 id is provided, otherwise an array of documents if multiple ids are provided.
Resolution:
  Most likely this is caused by passing parameters directly through to the find, and the parameter either is not present or the key from which it is accessed is incorrect.):

Mongoid::Errors::InvalidFind (
Problem:
  Calling Document.find with nil is invalid.
Summary:
  Document.find expects the parameters to be 1 or more ids, and will return a single document if 1 id is provided, otherwise an array of documents if multiple ids are provided.
Resolution:
  Most likely this is caused by passing parameters directly through to the find, and the parameter either is not present or the key from which it is accessed is incorrect.):

Mongoid::Errors::InvalidFind (
Problem:
  Calling Document.find with nil is invalid.
Summary:
  Document.find expects the parameters to be 1 or more ids, and will return a single document if 1 id is provided, otherwise an array of documents if multiple ids are provided.
Resolution:
  Most likely this is caused by passing parameters directly through to the find, and the parameter either is not present or the key from which it is accessed is incorrect.):

Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound (
Problem:
  Document(s) not found for class Card with id(s) 53bcb06f5269632748090000.
Summary:
  When calling Card.find with an id or array of ids, each parameter must match a document in the database or this error will be raised. The search was for the id(s): 53bcb06f5269632748090000 ... (1 total) and the following ids were not found: 53bcb06f5269632748090000.
Resolution:
  Search for an id that is in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error when searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching for multiples.):
